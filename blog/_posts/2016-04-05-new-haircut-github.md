After joining [GitHub](https://github.com) in February 2014, I was stuck with a long username. Fortunately, I didn't have to settle for it.

Now, I have [{{ site.github }}](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}).

#### But how?

GitHub is one of the few sites that has a [policy](https://help.github.com/articles/name-squatting-policy/) of releasing dormant usernames, and luckily there are plenty of them!

First, I looked for users that joined GitHub early on (2011 and before) and had little to no publicly activity (commits, repos, and followers/following). Then, all I had to do was contact [GitHub Support](https://github.com/contact) with the username I wanted.

And it worked.
