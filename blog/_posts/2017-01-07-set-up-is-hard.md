I often find that setting up a new project is the most humbling part of programming. There's just so much that can go wrong: you misspell a variable, download incompatible versions, or do something else that makes you question your sanity. Programmers new and old are all subject to it.

My best advice is to take a break.

Even if you feel as though you are *just one more thing* away from getting it to work. Because too often promises of stopping after the next failure are never honored. Usually, after a long walk or good night's sleep, *somehow* it ends up working itself out.

When it finally works, programming feels pretty close to a super power. And that makes everything---including the set up---worth it.
