Deep breathe in. Deep breathe out.

Not sure about you, but a lot happened to me in 2016.

I [traveled](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?usp=sharing&mid=1BZNBEm9z-CpvzOZ89alaRb8LZKg) a bunch, wrote (and deleted) many lines of [code](https://github.com/tmm), was hospitalized for some suspected weird travel-related disease (I'm fine!), finished 8/11ths of my Master's [degree](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/data-science), and started blogging again.

If you're reading this, you made it this far too! Congrats! You should reward yourself with your favorite tasty treat. I rewarded myself with a chance to catch my breathe.

On the top of my list was updating the very website wherein you are reading these words right now.

My old site felt---well, old. It wasn't particularly informative nor did it capture who I am very well. Take a look for yourself.

Very *2016* if you ask me. Lots of white space and various shades of gray. Not a lot of substance you can sink your teeth into. Kind of like [Steak-umms](http://www.steakumm.com), but without the adverse health effects and emotional scarring.

So I took inspiration from some of my [favorite](http://www.frankchimero.com) [places](https://medium.com) [and](https://www.producthunt.com) [designs](http://flowingdata.com) on the Interwebs to make it right.

I think it turned out nicely. (Let me know how much you hate it below.)

Good luck in 2017! You'll do great.
