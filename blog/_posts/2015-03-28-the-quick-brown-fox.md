You'll **find** this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a *file* in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  print "Hi, " + name

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
